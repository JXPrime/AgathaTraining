Agatha & StructureMap Training
==============================

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple demonstration of how to use [Agatha](http://davybrion.github.io/Agatha/) as a replacement for your WCF service layer.

Have you been frustrated every time you have to update your service references because your interface changed? Be frustrated no more!

Agatha supports a few different IoC containers, my example is using [StructureMap](http://structuremap.github.io/), because that's what my day job is using. :blush:

It does take a bit of wrapping one's head around, but so far has proved incredibly easy to use.
